# They are not the same because "int" means what is in the parenthesis is a whole number which 4.6 is not. 
print float(4.6)==int(4.6)
print int(3.7)
# It prints the number 3 because since you are asking it for a whole number (int) than it will round down to the nearest whole number.
# This does not work because there are too many format changes in one line of code.
# This doesn't work either because you cannot convert a string (text) to a float.
print float("three")
