print float(4.6)

print int(4.6)
print "Explanation: The float (which is a decimal) will print out the decimal. However the integer (which is a whole number) command will print out the number before the decimal."

print int(3.7)
print "Explanation: The integer 3.7 prints 3 because it is an integer, and (as we saw before) they print out the number before the decimal (or rounded down)."

#print int("4.5")
#print int("4 and 5")
print "Explanation: int('4.5') will NOT work because the integer has quotes around it, it will print in error."

#print "Problem 4) " + float ("three point six")
#print "Problem 4) continued..." + float("three")
print "Explanation or Problem 4: This will print an error because 'Three point six' are made up of letters (which isn't a number (so it wouldn't work in floats or integers)) also there are quotes around it, so that makes it a string."
