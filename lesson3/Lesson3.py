#Lesson 3: Types
1. float(4.6) and int(4.6) are not the same since int() only prints out whole numbers and float() lets the (not whole) number be not whole?
float(4.6)
int (4.6)
2. int(3.7) returns 3.
int(3.7)
3. int("4.5") does not work since int() does not print strings. int("4 and 5") also does not work for the same reason.
int("4.5")
int("4 and 5")
4. When you write float("three point six"), it does not work FOR THE SAME REASON. float("three") does not work for the same reason. (wow.)
float("three point six")
5. print Ok got it.
